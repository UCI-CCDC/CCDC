I bet you thought you were gonna do some pest control! Or ghost exterminations like in some make-believe story! You came to UCI with half-assed determination didn‘t ya?! How naive, you stupid brat! This is war! Not a battle to fix what‘s wrong! But a clash of truths! You and your fragile justice! You are me, NCCDC Red Team, I secure without a second thought, just like you attack servers without a second thought! The instincts of a curse against the so-called dignity obtained by human reason! It‘s a battle to determine who will be left standing in a 100 years!
